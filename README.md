# Website for UI & UR from Uruguay

We want to generate a website that showcase our abilities in code programming using Python. 

## Overview

  - The idea is to use the tools provided by the MIT ReACT program during the first two edX courses of Python (using NumPy and Plotting)to create a website that shows the evolution of the UI & UR from the Uruguayan Goverment website. 
  - This units: Unidad Indexada (UI) & Unidad Reajustable (UR) are common economic units that are used all over the world for bond emission by goverments. It's a way to add the impact of the inflation in the economy to a monetary tool for multiples purposes (Loans, penalties, etc). 
  - The whole objetive is to code a website that shows the data provided free by the Uruguayan goverment, showcase a graphic representation of that data using Python and make an estimated projection on how that graph is going to change in the future. 

## Domain & Data

  - The main data is the value of the unites provided by the official uruguayan central bank, that is posted daily from monday to friday since the year 2002. 
  - Will use the NumPy library to code the linear regression of that data and make estimates on how is going to  behave into the future. 
  - Will use Flask framework in order to create the website enviroment.
  - Ideally we should also create an algorithm that pulls the informations posted daily from the goverment website and automatically updates ours.

  - define domain of your project
  - how you modeled it
  - possible short-comings in your model

## Analysis & Results

  - The main results is to provide visual expression to the data and see if it got tendencies to keep growing over time. 
<!--
  - how did you analyze the data
  - what were the results
  - how do you interpret the results
-->

## Audience & Communication

  - The main audience is the people who are interested in such data for personal purposes, investigation or plain criosity.

<!--
  - who are you communicating your results to
  - what message are you trying to get across
  - why did you choose the presentation format you did
